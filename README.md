# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in **C++**, where a human player plays against an AI opponent. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal decisions. The game allows alternating turns between a human player (Player X) and an AI (Player O). 

This repository includes all the source code necessary to compile and run the game directly in your terminal.

## Features

- **Two players**: A human player (X) and an AI player (O).
- **Minimax AI**: The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move.
- **Game Modes**: Human vs AI.
- **Terminal-based interface**: The game runs in the terminal with a text-based board.
- **Win Conditions**: Horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
- **Draw Condition**: If no winner is found and no moves are left, the game ends in a draw.
